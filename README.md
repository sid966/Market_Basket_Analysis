# Market_Basket_Analysis
In this project i have done market basket analysis of the retail store transactions data to find association rules.
To do this i have used Apyori library of python to use apriori algorithm.
first load the data and then displayed
after that did preprocessing of data to make it in the required format of apriori function input
then used the apriori function to derive association rules
we have used :
min_support=0.005
min_confidence=0.2
min_lift=3
min_length=2

to derive association rules.
